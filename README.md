## RealEngine
A play on the UnrealEngine, of course.

## Description
Hobby rendering engine **never** intended to be a commercial product.

## Examples
[insert image here]

## Installation
- `git clone https://github.com/ah416/RealEngine.git --recursive`
- run the GenerateVS.bat
- click the VS solution
- build and run!

## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Roadmap
- further support for compute shaders and computation using OpenGL
- support Vulkan

## Authors and acknowledgment

- Much inspiration from [TheCherno](https://github.com/thecherno) and Hazel

## Project status
Slowed development for the time being.
